### Tools

> #### Concurrently [Concurrently Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently/v/5.2.0)
>
> - The usual way to run multiple commands concurrently is npm run watch-js & npm run watch-css. That's fine but it's hard to keep on track of different outputs. Also if one process fails, others still keep running and you won't even notice the difference.

> #### Nodemon [Nodemon Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon/v/2.0.4)
>
> - nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
